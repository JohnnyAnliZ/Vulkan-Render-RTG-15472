Done: 

mesh loading

load nodes(scene is not static)
    ObjectInstances are in world space, load the nodes(trimming ones that don't have anything) and compute the world transform of object ObjectInstances

    Get all instances by traversing the graph using a queue and bfs

    every frame, get all the root nodes and compute all the world transforms for the ObjectInstances objects

TODO:

//show debug lines and frustrum, add another debug camera
    command line camera choosing

//move



//cull
